Nature Park
Nature Park Sarathana is situated at the North-East corner of Surat City, which is approachable by Surat Kamrej Road. The site is covered with an area of 81 acres with river Tapi on the north side and Surat Kamrej road is on its south side. Land is fully vegetated with trees of Eucalyptus, Casurina and Mango etc. The site is an ideal place for the development of a zoo with the new concept of natural habitat design.

Prior to 1984 there was no zoo in South Gujarat. The people of the Surat city and surrounding villages, especially the students of the schools and colleges were deprived of the first hand knowledge about wild life. Keeping in view above, the Surat Municipal Corporation has prepared a plan for setting up a Nature Park.

The aim and objectives of the Nature park are enlisted below:

> To create awareness about wild life and its conservation among the visitors through exhibiting of animals in simulated habitat condition and by educational programmes.
> To breed endanger & extinct species found locally, regionally and countrywide in planned manner.
