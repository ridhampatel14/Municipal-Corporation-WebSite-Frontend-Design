              As we all know that education is the most essential and influential characteristic of one's life, it moulds the life and shape of every human beings. Without education we could not have progressed so far and that's why education is the most necessary portion after food and clothes. Education is the fundamental rights of each and every child. We-Surat Municipal Corporation-as a responsible governing body, focused on this core issue.
              <br>We have seen that the students belonging to low-income class are not enrolling themselves for the secondary education after passing primary education. There may be many issues affecting for their choice. One, either they have to join private schools or they have to stretch themselves for grant-in-aide schools far from their residence. Due to such adverse condition, the drop-out ratio has increased. We took it as a challenge and started secondary schools-SUMAN HIGH SCHOOL- initially at four different localities of Surat. We started four Gujarati Medium schools on 12th August, 1999.
              <br>This initiative of SMC was well received by the parents and the demand for the other Suman High School has arisen in different areas of Surat. Marathi community has wished that their children will get the quality education in their mother tongue. So, on 21st June,2002, two Marathi Medium Schools have established namely Suman-5 and Suman-6 at Limbayat and Pandesara respectively.
              <br>Since then we haven't looked back. At present, we are family of 18 Suman Schools providing quality education in five different mediums-Gujarati, Marathi, Urdu, Hindi, Udiya. Our main aim was to offer qualitative and quantitative education to thes low-income class students at the nominal fee. We are here to shape their future and become a part of great social revolution.

            Before 1991, 'the Suratis' had places of entertainment and recreation like gardens, auditorium, swimming pools, and cinema houses and so on; but there was no full-fledged public library as a source of knowledge and information. Several stray Reading Halls provided only newspapers, periodicals and journals to the book lovers. The libraries of schools and colleges were restricted for their students. Therefore, the common man or professionals, technical experts, persons associated with trade and commerce etc. really required a Central Library with the collection of books of their field and choice.

              <br><br>The District Judge of Surat was used to handle the city administration in 1846, and hence he shouldered the responsibilities of maintaining health and hygiene and collecting the revenue, which is presently being done by the Municipal Corporation. Under the Municipal Act of 1850, Mr. Roges the contemporary collector of Surat, established the office of Municipality on 23rd April, 1852, the first meeting of which was held on the 15th The Collector of Surat was an exofficio President of the Municipality. His office, in the initial stage, started functioning in a hall of the Nanpura Post Office building, but with the expansion of its work, the hall and the building could not accommodate the Municipality office and hence it required a larger premises. The building, presently used by the Municipal Corporation was built in 1644 in the reign of Mughal emperor Shahajahan, by one of his military officers, and it was known as. It was used as the caravanserai or the waiting room for the. At that time the said building was in a very worn-out and neglected condition and was owned by the government. Mr. Hope recommended the government to allot this building for the Municipality. The Municipality spent Rs.29,500/- for its renovation and repairs and turned it into an office building. It also underwent some need-based addition-n-alteration from time to time.              
              <br>Thus, The Municipality, along with its public services acquired and adorned its own office building. The Municipality served successfully to beautify Surat and to maintain its health and cleanliness for years together. But looking to its expansion and increase in population it became evidently necessary to transform the Municipality into Municipal Corporation, and it was done on the 1st October, 1966.             
              <br>As far as the local administrative bodies like Municipality or Municipal Corporation is concerned, they are supposed to perform certain obligatory duties-under 1949 Legislative Act of Mumbai Regional Municipal Corporation - such as to provide water, electricity, roads, and to maintain cleanliness for the general health of people and that of the town, At the same time there are certain voluntary functions like establishing and maintaining kinder garten centers, Libraries, Museums, Auditorium. Theaters, Gardens, Zoo and so on under the by-law article No.22 of section 66 of the said Act, the Municipal Corporation may contrive for the establishment and maintenance of Libraries and Reading Halls according its own discretion.
